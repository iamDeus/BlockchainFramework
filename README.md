# DecentralisedNetwork

Initially a learning experience, turned project, turned hobby.  
I decided I'll best understand blockchain technology by making my own.

Based on Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s Bitcoin: A Peer-to Peer Electronic Cash System.

Its a basic blockchain framework including:

+ Timeserver stamp
+ Proof of Work
+ HTTP requests
+ Consensus
+ Chain Validation

Using packages:

+ Flask 
+ Requests

This version DOES NOT run on multiple IP addresses but rather on multiple ports on your Macbook Pro.  
The framework comes with a set up manager tool called networkmngr.py. It's used to initialise a network of nodes, instruct to mine, setup a block or shut them down.

> _Later on I will implement IP nodes and convert from HTTP infrastructure to TCP ensuring less overhead and faster responses._
